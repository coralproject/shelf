# Shelf

[Shelf](https://github.com/coralproject/shelf) is a configurable service layer that publishes endpoints against functionality for: 
- [mongo aggregation pipeline queries](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/aggregation-introduction/).
- importing, formatting, and validation of data.
- management of relationships between pieces of data.
- management and generation of views of imported data.

All of the Shelf documentation (including installation instructions) can be found in the [Coral Project Documentation](https://coralprojectdocs.herokuapp.com/).

Also, the Shelf documentation [lives in Github](https://github.com/coralproject/docs/tree/master/docs_dir/xenia) in the `coralproject/docs/docs_dir/xenia` repository (as shelf was previously named "xenia").
