Package handlers contains the handler logic for processing requests.





## Variables
``` go
var Version verHandle
```
Version fronts the access to the ver service functionality.


## func Proxy
``` go
func Proxy(targetURL string, rewrite func(*web.Context) string) web.Handler
```
Proxy will setup a direct proxy inbetween this service and the destination
service using the rewrite function if specified. If the rewrite function is
not specified, the path on the target will be set to the target path
concatenated with the request path.
