## func Exec
``` go
func Exec(context interface{}, db *db.DB, set *query.Set, vars map[string]string) *query.Result
```
Exec executes the specified query set by name.


## func ProcessVariables
``` go
func ProcessVariables(context interface{}, commands map[string]interface{}, vars map[string]string, data map[string]interface{})
```
ProcessVariables walks the document performing variable substitutions.

In some cases we are just replacing the variable name for what is in the map.
If we have dates and objectid, that requires more work to convert to proper types.
This function is also accessed by the tstdata package and exec_test.go
