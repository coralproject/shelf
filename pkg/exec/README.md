# exec
    import "github.com/coralproject/xenia/pkg/exec"

Package exec provides support for executing Sets and their different types
of commands.






## func Exec
``` go
func Exec(context interface{}, db *db.DB, set *query.Set, vars map[string]string) *query.Result
```
Exec executes the specified query set by name.


## func PreProcess
``` go
func PreProcess(commands map[string]interface{}, vars map[string]string)
```
PreProcess walks the document preprocessing it for use.

We need to find and process variables. In some cases we are just replacing
the variable name for what is in the map. If we have dates and objectid,
that requires more work to convert to proper types.
